*NAME
kumostat

*SYNOPSIS
kumostat server-address[:port=19800] command &br;
kumostat -m manager-address[:port=19700] command

*DESCRIPTION
Get status from Server node.

*COMMANDS
:pid                        :get pid of server process
:uptime                     :get uptime
:time                       :get UNIX time
:version                    :get version
:cmd_get                    :get total number of processed get requests
:cmd_set                    :get total number of processed set requests
:cmd_delete                 :get total number of processed delete requests
:items                      :get number of stored items
:rhs                        :get rhs (routing table for Get)
:whs                        :get whs (routing table for Set/Delete)
:hscheck                    :check if rhs == whs
:set_delay                  :maximize throughput at the expense of latency
:unset_delay                :maximize throughput at the expense of latency

*DELAY MODE
If the delay mode is enabled, req/sec throughput is maximized at the expense of latency. This mode actually disables TCP_NODELAY option of all sockets.
The practice of this feature is as following: &br;
 - run some scripts that watches load of the kumo-server. (see source code of kumotop) &br;
 - if the load of kumo-server becomes high, enable delay mode by ''kumostat set_delay'' command. &br;
 - if the load of kumo-server becomes low, disable delay mode by ''kumostat unset_delay'' command. &br;

*EXAMPLE
$ kumostat svr1 items &br;
$ kumotop -m mgr1 hscheck
