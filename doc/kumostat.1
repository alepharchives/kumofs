.SH DELAY MODE
If the delay mode is enabled, req/sec throughput is maximized at the expense of latency. This mode actually disables TCP_NODELAY option of all sockets.
The practice of this feature is as following:
.PP
- run some scripts that watches load of the kumo-server. (see source code of kumotop)
.PP
- if the load of kumo-server becomes high, enable delay mode by
.B kumostat set_delay
command.
.PP
- if the load of kumo-server becomes low, disable delay mode by
.B kumostat unset_delay
command.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
$ kumostat svr1 items
.PP
$ kumotop -m mgr1 hscheck
